# AppGT

AppGT is the offical app for HackGT on the App Store and Google Play Store. The goal of this app is to simplify every hackathon participant's experience with a simple interface by centralizing essential information. This allows important links, a custom schedule, and relevant notifications to be quickly access throughout events.
